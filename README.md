## About The Project


Drive Pricer is a tool that aims to help people make informed financial decisions when purchasing a car. The standard metrics around gas mileage simply aren't useful for predicting the cost of gas for a vehicle. By estimating the fuel costs for a substantial portion of a vehicle's life, a buyer can better understand the true cost of that vehicle.

Drive Pricer's second purpose is to help people improve their environmental impact by connecting it to their pocket book.

## Installation

 Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https:://github.com/setfloat/drivepricer.git
   ```
 Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
Develop mode runs on port 8000 and uses a less performant development build with hot reloading.
  ```JS
  npm run develop
  ```

  To run in production, you must first build the production code
    
  ```JS
  npm run build
  ```
  
  Deploying utilizes a gatsby s3 plugin to push to an s3 bucket.

  ```JS
  npm run deploy
  ```
